      <description>I am originally from Brookings, South Dakota. I joined the Army immediately after high school to become an Explosive Ordinance Disposal technician (fancy army talk for bomb squad). Where I was able to see some amazing things around the world and interact with a bunch of phenomenal people.
Leaving the Army, I did a year of travel before ending up going to Southern New Hampshire University recieving my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Mathematics with a Minor in Education.</description>
