      <description>Overview I grew up playing the original version of Pokemon on my gray brick of a Gameboy, so what would be a better way to re-live my childhood other than digging through the data.

Historically, I have used the Caret package as my modeling framework, but we will use the more modern Tidymodels suite of packages made by Max Kuhn &amp;amp; Rstudio Team.</description>

      <description>I am originally from Brookings, South Dakota. I joined the Army immediately after high school to become an Explosive Ordinance Disposal technician (fancy army talk for bomb squad). Where I was able to see some amazing things around the world and interact with a bunch of phenomenal people.
Leaving the Army, I did a year of travel before ending up going to Southern New Hampshire University recieving my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Mathematics with a Minor in Education.</description>
