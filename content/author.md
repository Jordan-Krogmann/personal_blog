title: About Me
---

I am originally from Brookings, South Dakota.  I joined the Army immediately after high school to become an Explosive Ordinance Disposal technician (fancy army talk for bomb squad).  Where I was able to see some amazing things around the world and interact with a bunch of phenomenal people.

Leaving the Army I did a year of travel before ending up going to Southern New Hampshire University recieving my Bachelor's in Mathematics with a Minor in Education.  I partipated & won in a couple of undergraduate research projects pushing my interests towards stats and data science.  Luckily, a person in the Analytics Department at Global Campus took a chance and hired me as an intern right out of my undergraduate program.

I am still at Southern New Hampshire University as a Senior Data Scientist working on business problems like forecasting, funnel optimization, growth hacking, NLP, and anything daffy that comes up.  Thanks for reading :)
